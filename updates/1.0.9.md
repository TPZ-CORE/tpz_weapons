# What has been updated?

## Changelog - (Added, Fixed, Removed):

1. There was a **major** issue - mistake, attempting to check if player inventory was loaded on tasks by calling TPZ Inventory API, by that mistake, the resmon would go from `0.60` up to `1.80` - `2.50`. After fixing that issue, the resmon even with many tasks, it is now stable at `0.60-0.70`.
## Modified Files:

- client/tp-client_weaponclass.lua
- fxmanifest.lua
  
## Notes

1. Add on the configuration file (`config_store_products.lua`) the following:

```lua
-- The maximum slider quantity to buy items (not weapons).
Config.MaxSliderBuyValue = 10
```

2. Add the new locales:

```lua
    ["YOU_WILL_PAY"]                = "You will pay: ",
    ["DOLLARS"]                     = " dollars",
 ```
