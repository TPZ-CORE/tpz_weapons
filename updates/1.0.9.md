# What has been updated?

## Changelog - (Added, Fixed, Removed):

1. There was a **major** issue - mistake, attempting to check if player inventory was loaded on tasks by calling TPZ Inventory API, by that mistake, the resmon would go from `0.60` up to `1.80` - `2.50`. After fixing that issue, the resmon even with many tasks, it is now stable at `0.60-0.70`.
